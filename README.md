<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project implements a simple logistic regression model to analyze and predict binary outcomes. It visualization of the decision boundary and cost reduction over iterations. The model uses the sigmoid function to map probabilities and make classifications.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To use the model yourself, copy and paste the code into an IDE of choice.
Ensure you have python3 installed.

### Load Dependencies required
  ```sh
  pip install numpy matplotlib
  ```

<!-- IMPROVEMENTS -->
